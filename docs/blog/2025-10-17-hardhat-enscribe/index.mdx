Adding support for contract naming into dev workflows has always been our top priority. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a leading Ethereum developer environment. Itâ€™s TypeScript-first, fast, and built around a clean plugin architecture. Hence,  itâ€™s the perfect tool for contract management like deployment, testing, etc. We are excited to announce a plugin for the popular Hardhat ecosystem that adds contract naming to it.

## Naming your contract from the CLI

hardhat-enscribe is a Hardhat v3 plugin that assigns ENS names to contracts, handling the full flow for you: 

- subname creation 
- forward resolution and 
- reverse resolution

It auto-detects common patterns like Ownable and ReverseClaimer, waits for confirmations, and plugs neatly into a viem-powered stack.
It can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pnpm install @enscribe/hardhat-enscribe  
```

Letâ€™s create new Hardhat project to deploy a contract on Sepolia:

```bash
mkdir hardhat-example
cd hardhat-example
pnpm dlx hardhat --init
```

 This will generate a skeletal Hardhat project with a sample contract with the following project structure â€“

```bash
hardhat.config.ts
contracts
â”œâ”€â”€ Counter.sol
â””â”€â”€ Counter.t.sol
test
â””â”€â”€ Counter.ts
ignition
â””â”€â”€ modules
    â””â”€â”€ Counter.ts
scripts
â””â”€â”€ send-op-tx.ts
```

We can build our project with the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat build
```

Letâ€™s now deploy our contract on Sepolia. For this, weâ€™ll need to add configuration to interact with Sepolia. First, letâ€™s export some env variables for the RPC URL and the private key of the account that we want to use to deploy the contract:

```bash
export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<sepolia rpc url>
export SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=<your sepolia account private key>
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Now open the hardhat.config.ts file and add configuration for sepolia â€“

```Typescript
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  â€¦
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      type: "http",
      chainType: "l1",
      url: configVariable("SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"),
      accounts: [configVariable("SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY")],
    },
  },
}
```

Our sample contract Counter.sol can now be deployed on sepolia with:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition --network sepolia deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

Once deployed, we are now ready to name our deployed contract. We need to add the hardhat-enscribe plugin to the list of plugins first. Open the hardhat.config.ts file and add the plugin:

```Typescript
import hardhatEnscribePlugin from "@enscribe/hardhat-enscribe";
â€¦
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxViemPlugin, hardhatEnscribePlugin],
  â€¦
}
```

Then, invoke the plugin by passing the name and contract address in the command:

```bash
pnpm hardhat enscribe name mycontract.app.eth --contract 0x1234...abcd
```

This is what youâ€™ll see in the output â€“

```bash
normalized name is mycontract.app.eth

Naming completed successfully!
Contract Type: ReverseClaimer
Transactions: {
  subname: '0xb5a4131bb0bf3c2708a8181349998f57c76226559042cf68423aeefc74e8cd55',
  forwardResolution: '0xa6aa6ac9a0857aaeaff1ef3d69b2962ab01650230bc5c9d8d3108dcfb63cebfa',
  reverseResolution: '0xb1f260a587f793251804b6f809b4d1546d81dd98c1605c5eb7d812d1afc190b9'
}
```

##  Naming your contract from a Hardhat deployment script

You arenâ€™t limited to setting a name for a contract from the CLI though. Scripting is a very powerful feature of Hardhat that allows you to do more than just contract development. You can call APIs, interact with contracts and even interact with the blockchain. You can now name your contract from a script too and we shall now see how you can do that.

First, connect to the network and deploy the CounterModule:

```Typescript
import hre from "hardhat";
import CounterModule from "../ignition/modules/Counter.js";


const connection = await hre.network.connect();
const { counter } = await connection.ignition.deploy(CounterModule);
```

Next, get the walletClient â€“

```Typescript
 const [walletClient] = await connection.viem.getWalletClients();
 console.log(`Using account: ${walletClient.account?.address}`);
```

Now create a normalized name â€“

```Typescript
 const ensName = `wpsqhsld.abhi.eth`;
 const normalizedName = normalize(ensName);
```

We are now ready to set the name by using the enscribe library (more about this in the next blog) â€“

```Typescript
import { nameContract } from "@enscribe/enscribe";
â€¦

try {
   const result = await nameContract({
     name: normalizedName,
     contractAddress: counter.address,
     walletClient: walletClient,
     chainName: networkName,
     opType: "ignition-deploy-and-name",
     enableMetrics: true,
   });
  â€¦
} catch (error) {
  â€¦
}
```

Thatâ€™s it! Your contract can be deployed and named with a Hardhat script easily. You can see the full example here.

## Parting Thoughts

Our focus will always be on improving developer workflows for contract naming and the hardhat-enscribe is an important integration for us.

We are continuing to focus on  different ways to make contract naming better for developers. So go ahead and integrate contract naming today in your workflows! 

Happy naming! ðŸš€
