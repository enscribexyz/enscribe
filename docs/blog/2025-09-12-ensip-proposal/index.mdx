# ENSIP: Contract Metadata Standard and Text Records

Smart contracts power the onchain economy, but they lack proper identity infrastructure. When users encounter a contract address like `0x742d35cc567890c000c000c07c81c25d7df34793`, they can't easily verify what it does, who built it, or whether it's safe to use.

Enscribe has been working to solve this through contract naming. Now we're taking the next step by proposing a new ENS Improvement Proposal that establishes a comprehensive metadata standard for smart contracts.

## The Problem with Contract Identity

Smart contracts face several identity challenges:

- **Trust Issues**: Users can't easily verify if a contract is legitimate or malicious
- **Missing Documentation**: No standard way to find a contract's docs, source code, or audit reports  
- **Inconsistent Information**: Wallets and dApps show different (or no) contract details
- **Poor Developer Experience**: No standard API for contract discovery and metadata

While ENS enables human-readable contract names, the ecosystem lacks standardized metadata storage. Projects create custom solutions, users rely on centralized services, and critical information gets scattered across different platforms.

## Our Proposed Solution

We've [submitted an ENSIP](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensips/pull/50) that extends [ENSIP-5 (Text Records)](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/5) with standardized metadata fields for smart contracts. This creates one source of truth for contract information, stored directly in ENS records.

Imagine if instead of simply seeing a hex contract address you had a rich view of the contract such as this:

Our proposed standard would serve as a foundation to make such information available for smart contracts across Ethereum.


### New Text Record Fields

**Contract Classification**:
- `category`: Contract type (defi, dao, utility, gaming)
- `license`: Software license (MIT, Apache-2.0)
- `docs`: Official documentation links

**Security Information**:
- `audits`: Structured audit report data with auditor names and report links
- `proxy`: Proxy contract details and implementation addresses

### Compiled Metadata Resolver

The proposal introduces a new resolver profile for complete compiler-generated metadata. Building on [ENSIP-4's (Support for contract ABIs)](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/4) multi-encoding approach, it supports:

- **JSON formats**: Uncompressed and compressed
- **CBOR encoding**: For onchain parsing
- **URI storage**: IPFS, Arweave for large files

This metadata contains everything needed for contract verification: ABI definitions, compiler settings, source code hashes, and NatSpec documentation.

## Real Impact

This standard solves concrete problems:

- **Users** can verify contract authenticity before signing transactions
- **Developers** get standard APIs for contract metadata across all applications  
- **Projects** build professional contract identity that increases user trust
- **Ecosystem** reduces dependence on centralized services


## Contract Metadata in Action

We've implemented this metadata standard for our own contract as a demonstration. You can see `v0.enscribe.named.eth` on [ENS Manager](https://sepolia.app.ens.domains/v0.enscribe.named.eth) with all the proposed metadata fields populated (some values are placeholder for now).

Since the ENS manager app doesn't yet render contract metadata optimally (it's designed for user profiles), here's how we envision displaying contract metadata in applications built for contracts:

![ENS Manager showing basic contract metadata fields](ens-manager.png)
*Current ENS Manager view - shows metadata but not optimized for contracts*

![Enscribe contract profile view](mock-expanded.png)
*Enscribe's contract-focused interface - Technical details, security audits, and expanded metadata view*

The difference is clear: contract-specific interfaces can organize and display metadata in ways that help developers and users understand what they're interacting with.

## We Need Your Input

The proposal draws from our experience building contract naming tools, but community feedback shapes the final standard.

**Help us refine**:
- Technical implementation approach
- Additional metadata fields 
- Wallet and dApp integration needs
- Use cases we should address

## Review and Feedback

Enscribe makes smart contracts easier to trust by giving them human-readable names. This ENSIP extends that mission â€” moving from basic naming to complete contract identity infrastructure.
