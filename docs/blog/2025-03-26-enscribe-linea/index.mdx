We're excited to announce our latest milestone â€”Â  Enscribe has officially added support for the Linea Sepolia testnet!

Linea is an innovative Ethereum-equivalent zk-rollup solution developed by ConsenSys, designed to dramatically enhance Ethereumâ€™s scalability. It also happens to be the layer 2 technology that the upcoming [ENS Namechain](https://app.ens.domains/ens-v2) will be built on. This integration brings quicker, cheaper, and more efficient transactions while retaining the strong security guarantees and decentralization of Ethereum.

With Enscribe's support for Linea Sepolia, developers can now easily deploy smart contracts directly to the Linea network and assign human-readable Ethereum Name Service (ENS) names at the point of deployment. This makes smart contracts easier to use, manage, and verify, significantly improving the overall user experience for both developers and end-users.

## How to Get Started

import AppUrl from '@site/src/components/AppUrl';

Getting started with Linea Sepolia on Enscribe is simple:

Visit the Enscribe App at <AppUrl/>

## Benefits of Using Linea

Linea Sepolia offers several key advantages over the Ethereum mainnet:

**Faster Transactions**: Experience significantly quicker smart contract deployments and interactions compared to traditional Ethereum networks.

**Reduced Costs**: Enjoy dramatically lower gas fees, enabling more affordable smart contract development and testing.

**Ethereum Compatibility**: Effortlessly deploy existing Ethereum-compatible smart contracts without needing code modifications, providing a seamless transition to improved scalability.

**Enhanced User Experience**: Instantly readable ENS names eliminate confusion associated with cryptic hexadecimal contract addresses, improving clarity, trust, and overall usability.

## What's Next for Enscribe?

This integration with Linea Sepolia is just one step toward our broader vision of enhancing smart contract usability and trust across Ethereum and its vibrant ecosystem of Layer-2 solutions. We remain committed to supporting additional layer 2 network and continually improving our service based on community feedback and innovation.

We warmly invite you to explore Enscribe's Linea Sepolia integration and experience firsthand the future of scalable Ethereum deployments.
