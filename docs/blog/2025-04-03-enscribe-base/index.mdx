Hot of the back of our [Linea Sepolia announcement](https://www.enscribe.xyz/blog/enscribe-linea), we're also supporting the Base Sepolia testnet!

Base, developed by Coinbase, is an Ethereum Layer-2 solution built on Optimismâ€™s OP Stack, designed to deliver faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions while preserving Ethereumâ€™s security guarantees. Our integration with Base Sepolia provides a powerful new way for developers to effortlessly deploy smart contracts and immediately assign them Ethereum Name Service (ENS) names.

It also can be used to easily name existing smart contracts too.

With Enscribeâ€™s new support for Base Sepolia, your smart contracts gain human-readable ENS identities instantly upon deployment, greatly enhancing their discoverability, verifiability, and usability.

## How to Get Started

import AppUrl from '@site/src/components/AppUrl';

Getting started with Base Sepolia on Enscribe is simple:

Visit the Enscribe App at <AppUrl/>

Connect your Ethereum wallet (Coinbase Wallet recommended for Base).

Select "Base Sepolia" from the available network options.

Deploy your smart contract and assign it a user-friendly ENS subname in just a few clicks.

## Benefits of Using Base

Base offers several key benefits over the Ethereum Mainnet:

*Lower Transaction Fees*: Benefit from reduced gas costs compared to Ethereum mainnet.

*Fast & Efficient Transactions*: Deploy and interact with contracts quickly and seamlessly.

*Ethereum Compatibility*: Deploy your existing Ethereum contracts with minimal changes required.

## What's Next for Enscribe?

With Sepolia, Linea Sepolia and Base Sepolia all supported, we're getting ready for our mainnet deployments for developers to really start battle testing the Enscrbie services.

On top of this we're going to be announcing our first partner integrations which you'll definitely want to watch out for. This will be a bit step forward in establishing greater trust in smart contracts for users.

In the meantime, make sure you have a go with our Base service and let us know what you think!
