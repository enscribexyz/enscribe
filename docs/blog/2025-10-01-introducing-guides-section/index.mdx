As part of our mission to fix Ethereum UX, educating users on everything to do with naming smart contracts and ENS is a key part of this.

While we have a lot of technical documentation on our site, what's been missing is guides that tie together the content in an easy to follow manner. We're launching a new Guides section to help developers deploy and name smart contracts with Enscribe on L1 and L2 networks. Think of it as a hands-on companion to our technical documentation.

## What's New

The Guides section focuses on practical tutorials you can follow along. While our documentation covers technical details, these guides walk you through real workflows step by step.

## What You'll Find

### Quick Start Guides

We organized the most common use cases:

- [**Deploy & Name New Contract**](/guides/how-to-guides/deploy-and-name-smart-contract) â€” Deploy fresh smart contracts with ENS naming during deployment
- [**Name Existing Contract**](/guides/how-to-guides/name-existing-smart-contract) â€” Add ENS names to contracts that are already deployed  
- [**L2 Contract Naming**](/guides/how-to-guides/name-contract-l2-networks) â€” Name contracts on Layer 2 networks

### Conceptual Guides

For developers who want to understand the underlying concepts:

- [**ENS Primary Names Explained**](/guides/concepts/ens-primary-names-explained) â€” Forward vs. reverse resolution
- [**L2 Primary Names Explained**](/guides/concepts/l2-primary-names-explained) â€” Cross-chain ENS identity

Each guide walks you through the complete process. New to Enscribe? Check out [Deploy & Name New Contract](/guides/how-to-guides/deploy-and-name-smart-contract) to deploy your first named smart contract, or if you already have contracts deployed, use [Name Existing Contract](/guides/how-to-guides/name-existing-smart-contract) to add ENS names retroactively. Working on Layer 2? Check out [L2 Contract Naming](/guides/how-to-guides/name-contract-l2-networks) for network-specific considerations.

We will be expanding the guides and add more real world examples and use cases shortly.
