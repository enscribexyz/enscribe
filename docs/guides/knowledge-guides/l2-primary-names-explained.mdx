# What is an ENS L2 Primary Name?

Learn about L2 primary names - a new ENS feature that enables setting primary names directly on Layer 2 networks, making multi-chain identity management simpler and more cost-effective.

## Why L2 Primary Names Matter

Prior to August 2025, setting an ENS primary name required a transaction on Ethereum Mainnet, and only worked in L1 Ethereum. Since most user activity now happens on L2 networks like Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, this created a poor user experience.

L2 primary names solve this by allowing you to set primary names directly on Layer 2 networks, with automatic fallback to a default primary name on Ethereum.

:::tip Visual Comparison
**Before L2 Primary Names**: Set primary name only on Ethereum ‚Üí expensive, limited  
**With L2 Primary Names**: Set primary names on each L2 ‚Üí cheaper, network-specific
:::

L2 primary names were enabled with the [ENSIP-19](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/19/) standard.

## Understanding Primary Names vs Reverse Records

According to the [ENS documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/web/reverse#l2-primary-names), it's important to understand the difference:

**Reverse Record**: A mapping from an address to an ENS name (only part of a primary name)  
**Primary Name**: A complete bi-directional relationship where:
1. The ENS name resolves to your address (forward resolution)
2. Your address resolves back to the ENS name (reverse resolution)

For a primary name to work, **both directions must be properly configured**.

## Supported Networks

L2 primary names are now available on these networks:

| Network | Mainnet | Testnet |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Arbitrum** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Sepolia |
| **Base** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Sepolia |
| **Linea** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Sepolia |
| **OP Mainnet** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Sepolia |
| **Scroll** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Sepolia |

## How L2 Primary Names Work

### The Verification Process

The key concept is that **the forward address for a given chain must match the reverse record on that chain's reverse registrar**.

**Example scenario:**
1. You own `alice.eth` 
2. It resolves to `0x1234...5678` on Ethereum
3. You call `setName("alice.eth")` on Base reverse registrar
4. **This doesn't work yet** because `alice.eth` only has an Ethereum address set

**To fix this:**
1. Set the Base address for `alice.eth` by calling:
```solidity
setAddr(
  namehash("alice.eth"), 
  2147483653, // Base coin type
  0x1234...5678 // your address
)
```
2. Now both directions work:
   - `alice.eth` ‚Üí `0x1234...5678` on Base (forward)
   - `0x1234...5678` ‚Üí `alice.eth` on Base (reverse)

### Network Coin Types

Each network has a unique identifier for multi-chain resolution:

| Network | Coin Type |
|---------|-----------|
| Ethereum | `60` |
| Arbitrum | `2147483652` |
| Base | `2147483653` |
| Linea | `2147483656` |
| OP Mainnet | `2147483658` |
| Scroll | `2147483657` |

## Default vs Network-Specific Primary Names

### Default Primary Name
- Set on Ethereum Mainnet
- Works as fallback across all networks
- Best for users with same address everywhere
- Requires ETH on Ethereum for gas

### Network-Specific Primary Names  
- Set individually on each L2
- Overrides default primary name on that network
- Best for different names per network
- Requires ETH on that specific L2 for gas

### Choosing Your Strategy

**Use Default Primary Name when:**
- You want the same ENS name across all networks
- You use the same address on all chains
- You want simple, universal setup

**Use Network-Specific Primary Names when:**
- You want different primary names on different networks
- Your contract addresses differ across chains
- You want granular control per network

## Setting Up L2 Primary Names with Enscribe

### Prerequisites
- ENS name registered and configured
- Contract deployed on target L2 networks
- ETH for gas on Ethereum (for address records)
- ETH for gas on target L2 networks (for primary names)

### Process Overview

**For Wallets:**
1. Go to [primary.ens.domains](https://primary.ens.domains)
2. Connect your wallet and search your ENS name
3. Choose "Default" for universal setup or specific networks for targeted setup
4. Complete transactions for both forward and reverse resolution

**For Smart Contracts:**
1. Use Enscribe's L2 primary name feature
2. Connect to Ethereum mainnet first
3. Select target L2 networks
4. Complete multi-chain setup process

## Sync Times and Status

After setting primary names, sync times vary by network:

| Network | Sync Time |
|---------|-----------|
| Ethereum | ~1 block |
| Base | ~6 hours |
| Arbitrum | ~6 hours |
| OP Mainnet | ~6 hours |
| Linea | 8-24 hours |
| Scroll | ~1 hour |

## Common Use Cases

### Multi-Chain DeFi Protocol
```
protocol.mydefi.eth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ethereum: 0xabc...123
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Arbitrum: 0xabc...123 (same address)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Base: 0xdef...456 (different address)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Optimism: 0xabc...123 (same address)
```

### Personal Wallet Identity
```
alice.eth (default on Ethereum)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Arbitrum: Uses default alice.eth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Base: alice-base.eth (network-specific)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OP Mainnet: Uses default alice.eth
```
