# How to Name Your Smart Contract with ENS on Ethereum

Already have a smart contract deployed on Ethereum? Learn how to give it a human-readable ENS name using Enscribe, making your contract more discoverable and trustworthy.

**Before**: `0x742d35cc567890c000c000c07c81c25d7df34793`
**After**: `my-defi-vault.eth`

## What You'll Learn

This guides covers:

1. **Understanding contract compatibility** for ENS naming
2. **Using Enscribe's Name Contract tool** for existing contracts
4. **Managing the naming process** step-by-step
5. **Troubleshooting common issues**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- **Contract deployed** on Ethereum (mainnet or testnet)
- **Web3 wallet** connected (MetaMask, Safe, WalletConnect, etc.)
- **Contract ownership** or proper permissions
- **ETH for gas** fees on your chosen network

## Understanding Contract Types and ENS Resolution

Not all contracts support the same level of ENS naming. Enscribe automatically detects your contract type and add transactions to set forward and primary name accordingly.

### Contract Compatibility Check

Enscribe classifies contracts into two categories:

| Contract Type | Forward Resolution | Primary Name (Reverse Resolution) |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Compatible Contracts**<br/>*Ownable, ERC173, ReverseClaimer* | Yes | Yes |
| **Other Contracts**<br/>*No ownership interface* | Yes | No |

### What This Means

**Forward Resolution** (ENS name → contract address)
- Anyone can set this mapping
- Makes your contract findable by ENS name
- Example: `my-vault.eth` resolves to `0x742d35...`

**Primary Name/Reverse Resolution** (contract address → ENS name)
- Only the contract or its owner can set this
- Shows ENS name when users look up the contract address
- Example: `0x742d35...` displays as `my-vault.eth` in wallets

Enscribe automatically detects the type of your contract so you don't need to know the technical details.

## Step-by-Step Naming Process

### Step 1: Access the Name Contract Tool

1. Go to [enscribe.xyz](https://enscribe.xyz)
2. Click **"Name Contract"** in the navigation or use the direct link: [app.enscribe.xyz/nameContract](https://app.enscribe.xyz/nameContract)
3. Connect your wallet
4. Select the Ethereum Mainnet network

### Step 2: Enter Contract Information

#### Contract Address

![Contract Address](/img/guides/contract-address.png)

- Enter the address of your deployed contract
- Enscribe will automatically detect the contract type
- If you see a green checkmark saying contract implements required interfaces(Ownable, ReverseClaimer), your contract supports primary names

#### Choose Your ENS Name

![Contract Name](/img/guides/contract-name.png)

**Label Name**: The subdomain for your contract
- Use descriptive names: `defi-vault`, `nft-marketplace`, `dao-governance`
- You can auto generate a label name using the "Generate Name" button

**ENS Parent Domain**: Choose where to create your subdomain

![ENS Parent Domain](/img/guides/ens-parent.png)

**Option 1: Enscribe-Provided Parent** (Recommended for beginners)
- No additional permissions needed
- Instant setup
- Your contract gets: `your-label.deployd.eth`

**Option 2: Your Own ENS Domain**

![Your Own ENS Domain](/img/guides/choose-ens-modal.png)

- Requires you to own an ENS domain
- More control over branding
- Your contract gets: `your-label.yourdomain.eth`
- Better for established projects

### Step 3: Review and Execute

1. **Review details**: Double-check contract address and ENS name
2. **Start naming**: Click "Name Contract"
3. **Sign transactions**: Enscribe will open a modal with all the steps, approve each transaction in your wallet

Based on your contract type, you'll see different number of trasanctions:

![Contract Naming steps](/img/guides/name-contract-steps.png)

**Your own ENS domain without ERC173/ReverseClaimer**
1. Create subdomain
2. Set forward resolution

**Your own ENS domain + Primary name:**
1. Create subdomain
2. Set forward resolution
3. Set primary name

### Step 5: Verify Success

After completion, you'll see a success modal with:

- Contract address
- Your new ENS name for the contract
- Links to view txs on block explorer
- Share on X/Twitter and Farcaster

## Using Safe Wallet for Contract Naming

If you're using a Safe wallet (multi-signature), the process works slightly differently:

### Safe Wallet Setup

1. **Connect via WalletConnect**:
   - Choose WalletConnect in Enscribe
   - Copy the connection link
   - Paste in your Safe wallet app

2. **Transaction Approval**:
   - Transactions are queued in Safe
   - All signers must approve
   - Execution happens asynchronously

3. **Benefits**:
   - Multi-signature security
   - Team-controlled naming
   - Transparent approval process

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Transaction Failures

**Gas Issues**:
- Increase gas limit in wallet
- Try during lower network congestion
- Check you have sufficient ETH

**Permission Errors**:
- Verify you're the contract owner
- Check connected wallet address
- Ensure contract implements required interfaces


### Retry Failed Steps

If any transaction fails:
1. Enscribe detects completed steps
2. You can retry only failed transactions
3. No need to start over completely


## What Happens After Naming?

### In Wallets and dApps
- Your contract shows its ENS name instead of hex address
- Users can interact using the readable name
- Increased trust and recognition

### In Block Explorers
- Many explorers now support ENS lookups
- Search for your ENS name to find the contract
- Enhanced discoverability
