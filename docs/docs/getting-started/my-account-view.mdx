# My Account View

This view shows a details of a user's wallet addres with respect to a chain such as:
- address
- Associated ENS names
- Owned ENS names

Previously, if you wanted to check which ENS names your wallet address owned—or what contracts had been named using your account—you had to:

    Manually copy your wallet address
    Paste it into the Enscribe search bar
    Click the result to open your wallet address view

Now, that entire flow has been replaced by a simple, direct entry point: My Account menu option.

With this you can quickly see which ENS names your account owns as well as any associated ENS names:

    Open the Enscribe app
    Log in to your wallet and select a chain
    Find My Account in the left-hand navigation bar
    Click to view all the ENS names associated with the wallet data

Here's a visual guide on how to view your account details:
