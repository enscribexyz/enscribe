# Deployment History

import AppUrl from '@site/src/components/AppUrl';
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

The Deployment History view in the Enscribe App enables you to view contract deployments that have been made using the service.

## Getting Started

You can access the view from the main app located at <AppUrl/>.

You can also view the existing contracts named using Enscribe and under Enscribe provided ENS parent.

Here you can verify the transaction hash and ENS name in the ENS manager app.

The below video demonstrates how to use the service.
