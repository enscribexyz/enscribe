# ENS Terminologies

## What is Forward Resolution?

Forward resolution is the process of going from name to address. An address can have many ENS names forward resolving to it. The goal is to take a name, such as nick.eth, and convert it to an address, such as `0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5`

## What is Reverse Resolution?

Reverse resolution is the process of going from address to name. This is a crucial part of the ENS system, as it allows for any address to be resolved into a human readable name. Unlike forward resolution, in reverse resolution an address always reverse resolves to a single ENS name known as Primary Name.

Address` 0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5` reverse resolves to `nick.eth`

## What is a Primary Name?

The ENS name that you want a particular ETH account to be associated with. When set, it will be displayed instead of your `0x123abc...` address on integrating websites/apps. This is also often referred to as the "reverse record".

## What are TLD, 2LD and subnames (3LD+) ?

**TLD:** Top-level domain. This refers to names like eth, com, xyz which lie at the "top" of the naming hierarchy.


**2LD:** Second-level domain. This refers to a subname/subdomain of a top-level domain. For example, name.eth and name.com are both second-level names. A subname of a 2LD is a third-level domain or 3LD.


**Subname/Subdomain:** A child name like sub.name.eth, whose parent is name.eth. Also referred to as a "subdomain". Every name (except for the root node) has a parent. For example, name.eth is a subname of eth.

## What are Wrapped ENS names?
