# What is ENS?

In the ever-expanding landscape of Web3, interacting with long, unreadable Ethereum addresses like `0x4cbe58c50480...` is both error-prone and unfriendly. That’s where ENS — the Ethereum Name Service—comes in. It serves as the naming protocol of the decentralized web, providing human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, content hashes, smart contracts, and more.
- ENS maps human-readable names like `alice.eth` to Ethereum addresses and other identifiers.
- It’s a decentralized protocol built on Ethereum.
- It consists of a Registry, Resolvers, and Namehashing algorithm.  
- ENS names can be owned, transferred, subdivided, and resolved like DNS names.

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), like `.eth` and `.test`, are owned by smart contracts called registrars, which specify rules governing the allocation of their names. This enables seamless interoperability with the DNS (Domain Name System).

### ETH Registrar

The [ETH Registrar](https://docs.ens.domains/registry/eth) is the registrar for the `.eth` TLD. It allows for trustless decentralized names to be issued on the Ethereum Blockchain. Registration is done through smart contracts, and name ownership is secured by the Ethereum blockchain.

### ENS Registry

The [ENS Registry](https://docs.ens.domains/registry/ens) is a smart contract ([ENSRegistry.sol](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/registry/ENSRegistry.sol)) that serves as the single source of truth for all ENS domain ownership and control.
It stores three critical pieces of data for every ENS name:  
- **owner**: The address that controls the name.  
- **resolver**: The contract responsible for name resolution.  
- **ttl**: The time-to-live for the record.  

Each ENS name is identified using namehash — the algorithm used to process an ENS name and return a cryptographic hash uniquely identifying that name. Namehash takes a name as input and produces a node.

### Resolvers

A [Resolver](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/quickstart) is a smart contract that implements the logic to convert a name into the actual resource: an Ethereum address, content hash (like IPFS), or metadata.

Resolvers implement the PublicResolver interface, supporting:  
- `addr()`: Ethereum address  
- `text()`: Metadata like email, description  
- `contenthash()`: IPFS or Swarm hashes

### Advanced Features

- **Subdomain Creation**: Create subdomains such as `app.enscribe.eth` and delegate ownership to another address or app.  
- **Reverse Resolution**: Map a wallet or contract address back to its ENS name (used in wallets like MetaMask).  
- **Content hashes**: Map ENS names to decentralized websites on services such as IPFS or Swarm.  
- **Text Records**: Store metadata such as Twitter handle, avatar, or Discord ID against ENS records

### Integration in dApps

ENS names are widely supported in the Web3 ecosystem:  
- **Wallets**: [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)
- **Explorers**: [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [Chainlens](https://www.chainlens.com/), [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/)
- **Libraries**: [Viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem), [Wagmi](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi), [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js), [Web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j), and [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py)

ENS plays a critical role in making Ethereum more usable and accessible. By turning complex addresses into readable, verifiable identities, ENS helps bring clarity, trust, and UX improvements to dApps across the ecosystem.
